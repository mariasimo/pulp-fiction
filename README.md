## About The Project

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/UQruK5Wy86OWO8ssT1/giphy.gif)

Pulp fiction — A little fan fiction game is the first proyect I made at my [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/) Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp. After three weeks learning the fundamentals of front end, we had a monday to friday week to develop a game of our choice. 



### Built With  🛠

 This project is built upon canvas, lots of javascript and a little of css. I also made the graphics myself with [Pyxel Edit](https://pyxeledit.com/)
